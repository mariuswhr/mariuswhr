# Hi there, I'm Marius 🌟

I'm 19 and currently learning frontend design.  
I´m creating clean and modern websites.  
I'm also building a small gameserver hosting project — just for fun!  
This year, I'm excited to start my journey as an IT system integrator apprentice.

🤝 Always open to connect and learn from others  
🌱 Just getting started — but dreaming big

Thanks for stopping by 🩷
