# Hey, I'm Marius ðŸŒŸ

I'm 19 years old and currently learning frontend development, user interface design, and GLua scripting.
My main project is [Kobralost Roleplay](https://kobralost-rp.com/), a Garry's Mod DarkRP server that's proudly one of the leading communities in France, with over 120 players online daily. We're now expanding into Germany, and I'm excited to lead this project.

Thanks for stopping by ðŸ©·
